        <h2>About Documentation</h2>

        <p>
            Projects in the class require, essentially, three types of
            documentation:
            <ol>
                <li>In-line comments</li>
                <li>Javadoc comments</li>
                <li>Project README</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>In-line comments</h3>

        <p></p>
        While good style dictates that your code be as
        "self-documenting" as possible, through the use of
        descriptive-but-brief variable names, it also dictates that you
        comment on anything that's not 'obvious.'
        </p>

        <h3>Javadoc comments</h3>

        <p>
            This is where most of your documentation effort should go.
            The documentation I provided with the skeleton was produced
            from my comments using Javadoc -- note that class and method
            comments all begin with two stars and occasionally uses
            javadoc notation like
            <code>@see</code>
            and
            <code>@param</code>
            . You should revise and augment this documentation as
            needed. The book includes a brief discussion of javadoc
            starting on p. 85, and of course there are zillions of
            tutorials online.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you want to see what your documentation looks like, in
            Eclipse look under the Project menu for "Generate
            JavaDoc..." -- you shouldn't need to alter any of the
            default settings. Note that Git/GitHub will commit your
            documentation (in the
            <code>doc</code>
            folder) along with the rest of your project.
        </p>

        <h3>Project README</h3>

        I also ask you to edit the
        <code>README.md</code>
        file. It should be clear how to get started on writing this
        file, but for more information on how it can be formatted (using
        "Github-Flavored Markdown"), read <a
            href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics">this</a>
        about markdown basics.
