        <h1>Project 3: Supplemental Suggestions</h1>

        <p>
            Now that you've had some time to ponder project 3 (and,
            hopefully, get the checkers game running in proper MVC
            style--make sure you have an
            <code>Observable</code>
            and an
            <code>Observer</code>
            involved!), here are a few thoughts about how to make the
            transition to the networked version. Remember that, unlike
            the Chatter-related lab/projects, here the client and server
            have <em>very</em> different roles: the server 'hosts' a
            game which will be played by two clients (and, possibly,
            observed by other clients).
        </p>

        <p>
            First, think about making the client as <em>minimal</em> as
            possible. The client should incorporate the view and the
            controller: what's the <em>least</em> amount of behavior it
            could reasonably have? It needs to be able to display the
            current state of a checkers game, of course, and it should
            probably be smart enough to know whose turn it is (so it can
            prevent the user from trying to take a turn at the wrong
            time).
        </p>

        <p>
            You <em>might</em> also want to give the client the ability
            to decide whether the user is making a legal move, or you
            could give it the ability to eliminate obviously illegal
            moves (like moving a checker non-diagonally). That's up to
            you--though the most minimal client wouldn't even be able to
            do that. It's OK to have the server evaluate potential
            moves, too--it might not be the most efficient approach, but
            it's fine for the purposes of this project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then: what information, exactly, does the client need in
            order to be able to do its job? Hint: it probably does <em>not</em>
            need a reference to
            <code>CheckerBoard</code>
            object. How far can you minimize the client's information
            needs?
        </p>

        <p>Once you've decided exactly what the client will do,
            think about the kind of communication the clients and server
            will need. What will the client need from the server? What
            the client have to send to the server? Don't worry quite as
            much about minimialism here, but of course the more
            information you send back and forth, the potentially slower
            the game will be.</p>

        <p>As usual, the impact of your effort will be greatest if
            you use as much existing code as you can. Once you get the
            networked game working, then you can experiment with adding
            chat, improving the UI, etc.</p>

        <hr />

        <p>Now that I've discovered that the Oracle tutorial has
            been rewritten to use JSON instead of XML (so there's no
            helpful code for you to study), I should point out a couple
            key features of any class you want to encode or decode using
            JAXB.</p>

        <p>
            First, the class should be annotated with
            <code>@XmlRootElement</code>
            (and you'll also need to
            <code>import javax.xml.bind.annotation.*</code>
            ). So, for example, you might have
        </p>

        <code>
            import javax.xml.bind.annotation.*;<br /> @XmlRootElement<br />
            class MoveMessage {
        </code>

        <p>And so on.</p>
        <p>
            Second, your class needs to be composed entirely of "getters
            and setters." That is, the only constructor you have should
            be the default (no parameters) constructor, and for each
            instance variable
            <code>x</code>
            , you should have a
            <code>getX()</code>
            and
            <code>setX()</code>
            method. This is very easy to do in Eclipse: once you have
            your instance variables listed, just highlight that set of
            lines, then under the <strong>Source</strong> menu, select <strong>Generate
                Getters and Setters</strong>. Eclipse will write the proper
            methods.
