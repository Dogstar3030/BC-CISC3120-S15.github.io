        <h2>Using Eclipse (Outside of Class)</h2>

        <p>There are two places you might want to use Eclipse
            outside of class: on a machine you control, and on a College
            computer. In the first case, you can just install Eclipse
            (as explained below), and it should work easily.</p>

        <p>
            In the second case (College labs), Eclipse is available in a
            network folder which can be accessed on all machines. ITS
            recommends that you copy that folder to the desktop of the
            machine you're using. Or, copy the folder to your USB drive,
            instead of following the install-on-USB instructions below.
            This might save you some time, and make it easier to keep
            your work safe. </p>
            <p>If you do run Eclipse from the destkop, make sure you delete your file sfrom
            the computer when you're done working.</p>
            
            <p> If you
            need to work at other labs, you will need to have Eclipse
            installed on your USB drive (again, see below)<./p>

            <h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>

            <p></p>
            Installing Eclipse is fairly straightforward: download and
            unzip; put it wherever you want (hard drive, USB drive,
            etc). If you have trouble with the unzip, try installing <a
                href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I strongly recommend installing the Eclipse version called
            "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers"&mdash;the Windows
            version is <a
                href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/luna/SR1a/eclipse-jee-luna-SR1a-win32-x86_64.zip">here</a>.
            Once you've installed that, you need one more plugin. Under
            the "Help" menu, select "Install New Software...". On the
            window that pops up, click the "Add.." button and enter the
            URL
            <code>http://download.eclipse.org/egit/github/updates</code>
            . Once that's done, in the area labeled "type filter here",
            type
            <code>github</code>
            , and in the area below, you should see a single item,
            <code>Eclipse GitHub integration with task focused
                interface</code>
            . Select that item's checkbox, then click "Next" and do
            whatever is necessary to complete the install. Eclipse is
            ready to go.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Items for your USB Drive</h3>

        <p>
            If you're using Eclipse on USB, you should make sure that
            your Eclipse workspace is <em>also</em> on your USB drive.
            Once you select a place for it, you can tell Eclipse to make
            that your default workspace, so it will stop asking you each
            time you start.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, you may want to be sure that Java 8 is available to
            you&mdash;it's hard to predict what will be on the College
            machines. (You may not <em>need</em> to do this; if you
            don't have any trouble without this step, you can skip it.)
            To do this, download the Java 8 JDK (currently at
            <code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</code>
            ). When you run the installer, make sure it installs <em>on
                your USB drive</em>. Record the folder name (probably
            something like
            <code>e:\java\jdk1.8.0\</code>
            ).
        </p>
        <p>
            One last step: you need to be able to tell the operating
            system where to find this version of Java, so you'll write a
            very short script. Using Notepad, create a file in the root
            directory of your USB drive called something like
            <code>javaUSB.bat</code>
            (the name doesn't really matter, but it needs to end in
            <code>.bat</code>
            ). In that file, type one line:
        </p>


        <code>set Path=java\jdk1.8.0\bin;%Path% </code>

        <p>Note: don't use a drive letter, but otherwise make sure
            the path matches the name of the folder where you installed
            Java.</p>

        <p>In order to run Eclipse, and make sure that you have the
            right version of Java, open a command window and issue three
            commands:</p>

        <code>
            E: <br />javaUSB <br /> eclipse\eclipse.exe<br />
        </code>

        <p>Again, the drive letter and particular paths may vary
            depending on how you've set up your USB drive.</p>
